# Leaven-Fall
My first game that I've been developing on and off since late 2016.
From coding, to art, to writing the story, I've done most of it myself.

Story Synopsis
Ember Flaminâ€™, Chase Robinson, Lea and Leo Merlot, and Bree Stunner join forces to take down seven elementals hellbent on taking over Leaven City, and the world. With their Ace Elite Operator Neo, team C.E.L.L.B. must track down each elemental, bring them home, and go back to their vacation before Leaven City falls.
